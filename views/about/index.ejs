                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>Spread A Smile India was founded by <strong>Sangita Mehra</strong>, a former fashion designer from the Mehrasons Jewellers family, who gave up her successful business to devote herself to social work. Moved by the plight of street children in Delhi, she decided to "lose herself in the service of others."</p>
                
                <p>Sangita started this grassroots effort with her older son, Aashray, beginning with just 10 local street children in their neighborhood. Initially operating under the auspices of the family's Mehrasons Jewellers Charitable Trust, the NGO began very modestly, providing food, clothing, and shelter to these children.</p>
                
                <p>What started as immediate relief gradually evolved into a comprehensive program including informal classes, counseling, and connections with government schools, laying the foundation for our current education-focused approach.</p>
