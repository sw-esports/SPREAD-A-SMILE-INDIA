                <h2>About Our Education Program</h2>
                <p>Helping street children enroll in government schools is our flagship program. We provide admission assistance, monitor attendance, and interface between schools and families. By 2016, over 100 children successfully enrolled in school who otherwise would have remained begging on the streets.</p>
                
                <p>The emphasis is on reducing the dropout rate. Those children in school "are choosing not to beg any longer" - a transformation that lies at the heart of our mission to help kids transition "from streets to classrooms."</p>
