                <p>For older children and mothers, Spread A Smile offers skills training to improve livelihood prospects. Our vocational training program doesn't just teach skills‚Äîit gives independence and dignity to our beneficiaries. We believe that "step two" after schooling is to help kids secure jobs so they can stay off the streets permanently.</p>
                
                <p>Our programs focus on practical skills that have immediate market demand, ensuring that our trainees can start earning within a short period of completing their training.</p>
